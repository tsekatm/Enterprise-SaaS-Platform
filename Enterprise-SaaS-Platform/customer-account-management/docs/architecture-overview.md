# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The Customer Account Management System follows a layered architecture designed for maintainability, testability, and scalability. Each layer has specific responsibilities and communicates with adjacent layers through well-defined interfaces.

### Layers

1. **Frontend Layer**
   - Presentation of data to users
   - User interaction handling
   - State management
   - Client-side validation

2. **Controller Layer**
   - HTTP request handling
   - Input validation
   - Response formatting
   - Error handling

3. **Service Layer**
   - Business logic implementation
   - Transaction management
   - Integration with external services
   - Complex validation rules

4. **Repository Layer**
   - Data access operations
   - Query optimization
   - Database schema management
   - Data mapping

5. **Utility Layer**
   - Cross-cutting concerns
   - Logging and monitoring
   - Caching mechanisms
   - Response optimization

## Performance Optimization

The system includes several performance optimizations:

1. **Database Query Optimization**
   - Strategic indexing for common search fields
   - Optimized relationship traversal algorithms

2. **API Response Optimization**
   - Response compression using gzip
   - JSON payload optimization
   - Efficient serialization techniques

3. **Frontend Optimization**
   - Component memoization
   - Lazy loading
   - Debounced search operations
