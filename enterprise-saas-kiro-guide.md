# Enterprise SaaS Platform - Kiro Development Guide

## Project Overview
Build a comprehensive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform that demonstrates enterprise-grade architecture, multi-tenant capabilities, and production-ready features using Kiro's agentic AI development approach.

## Core Features to Implement
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Isolated data per organization
- **User Management**: Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Sales Rep, Viewer)
- **Contact Management**: Companies, leads, deals pipeline
- **Activity Tracking**: Emails, calls, meetings, notes
- **Reporting Dashboard**: Analytics and KPIs
- **API Integration**: Third-party services (email, calendar, payment)
- **Notification System**: Real-time updates and email notifications

## Kiro Setup Strategy

### Phase 1: Initialize with Kiro Specs

# CRM Platform Requirements

## Primary User Stories
- **UC1**: As a Sales Manager, I shall be able to create and manage customer accounts so that I can track all customer interactions
- **UC2**: As a Sales Rep, I shall be able to log activities against contacts so that the team has visibility into customer engagement
- **UC3**: As an Admin, I shall be able to configure user roles and permissions so that data access is properly controlled
- **UC4**: As a User, I shall be able to view real-time notifications so that I stay informed of important updates

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **NF1**: The system shall support up to 10,000 concurrent users per tenant
- **NF2**: The system shall ensure 99.9% uptime
- **NF3**: The system shall comply with GDPR and SOC2 requirements
- **NF4**: The system shall provide sub-200ms API response times
```

# CRM Platform Technical Design

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Query
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: Auth0 or AWS Cognito
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or similar
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Search**: Elasticsearch
- **Message Queue**: Bull Queue with Redis

## Database Schema
### Core Tables
- organizations (tenant isolation)
- users (with role assignments)
- contacts (companies and individuals)
- deals (sales pipeline)
- activities (interactions and notes)
- notifications (real-time updates)

## API Design
- RESTful APIs with OpenAPI documentation
- GraphQL endpoint for complex queries
- WebSocket for real-time notifications
- Rate limiting and request validation
```

### Phase 2: Leverage Kiro's Key Features

#### Steering Configuration (.kiro/steering)
```yaml
# Project steering rules
coding_standards:
  - "Use TypeScript strict mode"
  - "Follow Clean Architecture principles"
  - "Implement comprehensive error handling"
  - "Write unit tests for all business logic"
  - "Use dependency injection patterns"

security_practices:
  - "Validate all inputs"
  - "Implement proper SQL injection prevention"
  - "Use parameterized queries"
  - "Encrypt sensitive data at rest"
  - "Implement proper session management"

api_design:
  - "Follow RESTful conventions"
  - "Use consistent error response format"
  - "Implement proper pagination"
  - "Add request/response validation"
  - "Include comprehensive API documentation"
```

#### Hooks Configuration
Set up automated hooks for:
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript checking
- **Security**: OWASP security scanning, dependency vulnerability checks
- **Testing**: Automated unit test execution, integration test runs
- **Documentation**: API docs generation, README updates
- **Database**: Migration validation, schema drift detection

### Phase 3: MCP Integration Strategy

#### AWS Integration (if using AWS)
```javascript
// Use AWS MCP servers for:
- AWS RDS for managed PostgreSQL
- AWS ElastiCache for Redis
- AWS S3 for file storage
- AWS SES for email notifications
- AWS CloudWatch for monitoring
```

#### Development Tools MCP
```javascript
// Integrate with:
- GitHub for version control
- Slack for team notifications
- Linear/Jira for project management
- Stripe for payment processing (if needed)
```

## Development Workflow with Kiro

### Day 1-2: Project Initialization
1. **Create Kiro workspace**: Initialize new project with specs
2. **Database Design**: Let Kiro generate Prisma schema from requirements
3. **API Structure**: Generate Express.js boilerplate with TypeScript
4. **Authentication Setup**: Implement JWT-based auth with role management

### Day 3-5: Core Development
1. **Multi-tenant Implementation**: Kiro can help implement row-level security
2. **CRUD Operations**: Generate REST endpoints for all entities
3. **Frontend Components**: Create React components with proper TypeScript types
4. **State Management**: Implement Redux Toolkit or Zustand patterns

### Day 6-8: Advanced Features
1. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket implementation for notifications
2. **Search Implementation**: Elasticsearch integration for full-text search
3. **File Management**: S3 integration for document storage
