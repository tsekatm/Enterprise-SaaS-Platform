# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Authentication System provides secure user registration, login, and account management capabilities for the Customer Account Management platform. This feature ensures that only authorized users can access the system, with appropriate role-based permissions and robust security measures to protect sensitive data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Registration

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to create an account, so that I can access the Customer Account Management system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the registration form THEN the system SHALL display fields for email, password, name, and other required information.
2. WHEN a user submits the registration form with valid information THEN the system SHALL create a new user account and send a verification email.
3. WHEN a user submits the registration form with invalid information THEN the system SHALL display appropriate validation errors.
4. WHEN a user attempts to register with an email that already exists THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.
5. WHEN a user completes registration THEN the system SHALL enforce strong password requirements (minimum length, complexity, etc.).

### Requirement 2: Email Verification

**User Story:** As a newly registered user, I want to verify my email address, so that I can confirm my identity and activate my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL send a verification email with a secure, time-limited token.
2. WHEN a user clicks the verification link THEN the system SHALL verify the token and activate the account.
3. WHEN a user attempts to log in before verifying their email THEN the system SHALL prompt them to complete verification.
4. WHEN a verification token expires THEN the system SHALL allow users to request a new verification email.
5. WHEN a user successfully verifies their email THEN the system SHALL notify them and enable full account access.

### Requirement 3: User Login

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log in to the system, so that I can access my account and use the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the login form THEN the system SHALL display fields for email and password.
2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and grant access to the system.
3. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message.
4. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL create a secure session with appropriate expiration.
5. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication.

### Requirement 4: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want to enable multi-factor authentication, so that I can add an extra layer of security to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their security settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to enable MFA.
2. WHEN a user enables MFA THEN the system SHALL support industry-standard methods (e.g., TOTP, SMS).
3. WHEN a user with MFA enabled logs in THEN the system SHALL prompt for the second factor after password verification.
4. WHEN a user loses access to their MFA device THEN the system SHALL provide a secure recovery process.
5. WHEN a user successfully completes MFA THEN the system SHALL grant access to the system.

### Requirement 5: Password Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my password, so that I can maintain the security of my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user forgets their password THEN the system SHALL provide a secure password reset process.
2. WHEN a user requests a password reset THEN the system SHALL send a time-limited reset link to their verified email.
3. WHEN a user sets a new password THEN the system SHALL enforce password strength requirements.
4. WHEN a user changes their password THEN the system SHALL invalidate all existing sessions.
5. WHEN a password reset link is used THEN the system SHALL verify the token before allowing password change.

### Requirement 6: Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my session to be managed securely, so that unauthorized access to my account is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL create a secure, encrypted session token.
2. WHEN a user's session is inactive for a defined period THEN the system SHALL automatically expire the session.
3. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL immediately invalidate their session.
4. WHEN a user accesses the system from a new device THEN the system SHALL notify them of the new login.
5. WHEN a user's session is compromised THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to revoke all active sessions.

### Requirement 7: Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to assign roles to users, so that they have appropriate access permissions within the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is created THEN the system SHALL assign a default role with minimal permissions.
2. WHEN an administrator assigns a role to a user THEN the system SHALL update their permissions accordingly.
3. WHEN a user attempts to access a feature THEN the system SHALL verify they have the required permissions.
4. WHEN a user's role changes THEN the system SHALL immediately update their access permissions.
5. WHEN an administrator views user management THEN the system SHALL display current roles and permissions.
